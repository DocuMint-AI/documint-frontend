## 🔧 API Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and customize:

```env
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000           # Backend server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT=/api/upload                  # File upload endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROCESS_ENDPOINT=/api/v1/process-document    # Document processing endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_QA_ENDPOINT=/api/v1/qa                       # Q&A endpoint

# App Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760                       # Max file size in bytes (10MB)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_FORMATS=.pdf,.doc,.docx           # Supported file formats
```

### Mock API (Default)
The application includes a built-in mock API that simulates real backend responses:
- Instant responses with sample data
- No external dependencies required
- Perfect for development and testing

### Real FastAPI Backend
To connect to a real backend, enable "Real FastAPI Backend" in settings:
- Requires a running FastAPI server
- Uses environment variables for endpoint configuration
- Expected endpoints (configurable via .env):
  - `POST ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}${NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT}` - File upload
  - `POST ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}${NEXT_PUBLIC_PROCESS_ENDPOINT}` - Document analysis
  - `POST ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}${NEXT_PUBLIC_QA_ENDPOINT}` - Question answering

## 🎨 Theming

The application features a comprehensive dark/light theme system:
- **Light Theme**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for extended use
- **System Preference**: Automatically detects user's system preference
- **Persistent**: Theme choice is saved in localStorage

## 📱 Responsive Design

Optimized for various screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full panel layout with resizable dividers
- **Tablet**: Stacked panels with touch-friendly controls
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with panel navigation

## 🔒 Data Handling

- **Local Storage**: Documents and analysis results stored locally
- **Privacy**: No data sent to external servers in mock mode
- **Security**: File validation and size limits enforced
- **Cleanup**: Easy data clearing through settings page

## 🚀 Deployment
